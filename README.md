Profiley McProfileface

Just decided to make my github profile a work of art

I'm a big fan of Github stars & lists, but I haven't found any good profile copypasta to show that. Soooo.... I am going to make it. 

Come back.... soonish... to see the progress.

List of repos I'm going to possibly fork to figure this out.
